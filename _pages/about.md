I am an associate professor at the School of Information Sciences ([iSchool](https://ischool.illinois.edu/)) at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/). I specialize ih natural language understanding (NLP) with a particular focus on biomedical text. I use a combination of data-driven analytical techniques and knowledge-based semantic approaches to extract and organize knowledge buried in textual artifacts, with benefits for biomedical discovery and scholarship, and healthcare outcomes.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
