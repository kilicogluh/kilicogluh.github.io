I am an associate professor at the School of Information Sciences [(iSchool)](https://ischool.illinois.edu/) at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/). I am also affiliated with the [National Center for Supercomputing Applications](https://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/), [Center for Health Informatics](https://chi.healtheng.illinois.edu/), [Division of Nutritional Sciences](https://nutrsci.illinois.edu/), [Personalized Nutrition Initiative](https://personalizednutrition.research.illinois.edu/) and [Beckman Institute](https://beckman.illinois.edu).

My [lab](lab) specializes in natural language processing and machine learning with a particular focus on biomedical text. We use a combination of data-driven analytical techniques and knowledge-based semantic approaches to extract and organize knowledge buried in textual artifacts, with benefits for biomedical discovery and scholarship, and healthcare outcomes. 

Prior to joining the [iSchool](https://ischool.illinois.edu/) in 2019, I was a research scientist at the U.S. [National Library of Medicine](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/), [National Institutes of Health](https://www.nih.gov/), where I led the Semantic Knowledge Representation project. I earned my PhD in [Computer Science](https://www.concordia.ca/ginacody/computer-science-software-eng.html) from [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/).
