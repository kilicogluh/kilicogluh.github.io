<b>Project Title:</b> COMBINI: connecting Complementary Medicine and Biological kNowledge to support Integrative Health<br>
<b>Funding</b>: National Institutes of Health/National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (<a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/CUrvF8wydEaPadt4gpzU8Q/project-details/10941569">U01AT012871</a>)<br>
<b>Project Period</b>: 2024-2029<br>
<b>Role</b>: PI; <a href="https://med.umn.edu/bio/rui-zhang">Rui Zhang</a>, UMN and <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/tao-cui-ph-d/bio-20563927">Cui Tao</a>, Mayo Clinic Jacksonville (MPIs) <br>

Complementary medicine (CM) interventions are increasingly used by health care consumers and accepted by the medical community, although much remains poorly understood about their effectiveness and safety as well as the underlying biological mechanisms through which they affect health and well-being. Published literature is a growing source of evidence on CM approaches; however, much of this evidence remains in unstructured text in specialty journals, creating barriers for effectively integrating the evidence with conventional medicine. The proposed research will develop informatics resources (ontology, knowledge graphs) and literature mining tools to consolidate the high-quality evidence on CM approaches and integrate it with conventional medicine in a machine-readable and AI-ready form, and will demonstrate the utility of these resources for knowledge management and scientific discovery in complementary and integrative health. <br>
