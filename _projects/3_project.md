<b>Project Title:</b> Automated Indexing for Publication Types and Study Designs<br>
<b>Funding</b>: National Institutes of Health/National Library of Medicine (<a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/ZhtvUQFSWkK_hhAahgZoPA/project-details/10715907">R01LM014292</a>) <br>

Multi-Tagger is an automated tool for assigning publication types and study designs to biomedical articles, preprints and manuscripts. In this project, we develop Multi-Tagger 2.0, to handle a wider variety of study designs, articles, users and use cases, and to ensure that the data are disseminated in a form that is appropriate to each different type of user. These studies will greatly enhance retrieval of relevant articles by a wide range of biomedical end-users, including groups studying the effectiveness of medical interventions, those studying preclinical animal models of human disease, and pharmaceutical companies developing new drug treatments.
